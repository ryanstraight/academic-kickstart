## Topics

+ What is a cyborg?
+ Sorite's paradox
+ Replacement
+ Neurorehabilitation
+ Cybernetic vision
+ When? What's worse?

---

# What is a cyborg?

"Cybernetic organism"

--

Cybernetic(s): The theoretical study of communication and control processes in biological, mechanical, and electronic systems, especially the comparison of these processes in biological and artificial systems.

--

Cyborg: A person whose physiological functioning is aided by or dependent upon a mechanical or electronic device

--

Haraway: Non-naturalist human

Verbeek: Border-blurring entity, uniting both human and nonhuman elements


---

# When did we become cyborgs?

- We always have been? 
- Stiegler: humanity is an invention of technology, not other way around

---

# Sorite's paradox

Where is the line?

---

# Replacement?

- Think about your computer.
- You've replaced every part.
- Is it the same computer?
- The issue becomes **metaphysical**

---

# Example: The Doctor

---

# Neurorehabilitation

- Child suffers injury and is essentially brain-dead.  

- New procedure: "neuroreconstruction"
- ~6 months to grow "new" brain

--

- Child loses all memories, possibly will have different attitude/temperament  

- Needs re-educated like a newborn, will catch up with peers in ~4 years
- Is it the same child?

---

# Cybernetic vision

- Stem-cell repairs macular degeneration

--

- What if cells were synthetic?

--

- What if repaired via electrodes?

--

- What if vision were _replaced_ with artificial stimulation?

---

# When do we care?

EBEs

---

# When do we care?

- Non-human mode of relationship and reaction or response may affect a person at a deep and pervasive level
- "That's unnatural!"

---

# What's "worse?"

- Biological human augmented beyond recognition
- AI with no corporeal form

---

# A Return to Postphenomenology

There is a relation between the subject and the object that comes about mediated by technology. Technology is a medium which mutually constitutes the subject and the object.

--

- Intentionality: makes visible the inextricable connections between humans and the world

---

# Cyborg intentionality?

- **Mediated** intentionality
- Remember the relations?

```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://img.swipeusercontent.com/1920/o/5xhpjkcfM0nBzHK3KwbVhfDrGSNPmP6DVTLdlJhXzrlNKw.png')
```


---

# Mediated intentionality

- Except *alterity*, human intentionality is **mediated** by technology
- Binoculars, thermometers, A/C, etc.

---

# *Hybrid* intentionality

- When intentionality goes **both** ways or...
- when they **merge**

---

# Fusion/cyborg relation

(human/technology) --> world

---

# Posthuman

## vs

# Transhuman

---

# Posthuman

- Consider human-technology relations when thinking about what it means to be human
- Moves beyond "humanism"

---

# Transhuman

- Deals more with the physical fusion of human and technology
- Moves beyond "human"

---

# Composite relation

- Related to hermenutic
- Double intentionality:
     - technology toward **its** world
     - humans toward result
     
---
# Hermeneutic

human --> (technology -- world)

# Composite

human --> (technology --> world)

---

# Composite relation

Examples?

--

```{r, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('graveyard.jpg')
```

---

# Alteration relation

- Self-reflexive
- I --> Technology --> I

---

# Augmentation relation

- Adds extra layer of being directed at the world. 
- See the world *and* information *about* the world
- (I--Technology) --> World --> (Technology--World)
