<p>I was reading Katie Linder’s Medium essay <a href="https://medium.com/@katie__linder/when-do-you-call-yourself-an-expert-f273b17a02e9#.jpz9ksg5k">When Do You Call Yourself an Expert</a> on the same day that listened to her <a href="http://ygtpodcast.com/ep23/">Imposter Syndrome</a> episode on the You’ve Got This podcast while getting ready for Faculty Forum. I don’t think that’s a coincidence, honestly. I mean, the timing might be but I’m clearly drawn to this topic. So, I thought I’d write up my own thoughts about it and publish them on the internet because, hey, bravery comes before confidence.</p>
<p>The essay reminded me of what I feel like was my first out there moment in which I was also interviewed for a podcast. Hers was for the <a href="http://teachinginhighered.com/episodes/">Teaching in Higher Ed podcast</a> hosted by the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/bonni208">Bonnie Stachowiak</a>, while mine was the <a href="https://immersivelrn.org/resources/the-versatilist-podcast/">Versatilist podcast</a>, hosted by the wonderfully welcoming Patrick O’Shea. Like Katie, I can safely say the experience was enjoyable, there’s nothing wrong with it, and I’m not unhappy with the result. To be fair, I’ve never actually even listened to <a href="https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/versatilist/episodes/2015-10-26T10_27_09-07_00">my Versatilist podcast episode</a> as I a) can’t abide the sound of my own voice (an unfortunate state of affairs considering I teach fully online and record myself teaching upwards of 4 times a week), and b) well, precisely what I’m getting into with this piece.</p>
<p>When I did the Versatilist I had just begun my teaching and had only just recently graduated with my Ph.D, though I was already full-time faculty and was taking over as Program Director while the former PD was on sabbatical. Needless to say, I was a bit out of my depth and unprepared, considering I got so few chances to teach while in graduate school as I was working full time as a trainer for the University’s IT department. Regardless, when I was asked to be on the podcast I thought, ‘Sure, why not?’ Again, bravery before confidence, right?</p>
<p>So I did the podcast and I think it went fine. I enjoyed the 45-ish minutes and never really felt like I didn’t know what I was talking about, but I didn’t (and to a certain extent still don’t) feel like an <em>expert</em> in any particular field. That’s not to say I’m not working on it but I don’t feel comfortable wearing the badge just quite yet. Maybe that’s why I was a good fit for the Versatilist: Jack of all trades and master of none? Who knows?</p>
<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/mike-sound-system-podcast-1737612/"><img src="mic.png" align="right" alt="By Mindthaw via Pixabay."></a>
One scary thing for me was the idea that there would now be a record of me rambling on about this and that, from my doctoral research to my experience teaching as new faculty, but that anyone could access it at any time and <em>I couldn’t be there to respond</em>. If I tweet something or say something in class there’s an avenue for discussion, for dialog, be it synchronous or asynchronous. Being a guest on a podcast is, obviously, being interviewed and having that interview published: it’s out there and that sole fact invites scrutiny. (Going on another this week, coincidentally.) So maybe it’s more a fear of making a mistake and being caught out.</p>
<p>Anyway, one point I wanted to make in the podcast (and why we’ve taken this winding path) was that I think I’ve always been hungry for something different. I’m a neophile, a fan of novelty with a great love of the new-and-improved. That is to say, I’m always looking for more… more information, more methods, more theories, more examples, more tools. More, more, more. I’m afraid that if I ever find myself settling comfortably into the <em>expert</em> chair then that part of me could disappear, as if expertise were a destination and not a journey (to get all cat-hanging-from-a-ledge-motivational-poster for a minute). I don’t want that to happen. Satisfaction is having one foot in the grave or some such.</p>
<p>Maybe it would help new graduates or junior faculty to see that others at the same career point are also in the same boat, confidence- or bravery-wise. It’s a long road and not one that has any particular sign posts or even a decent map. We have to make our own ways, sometimes even cut our own paths<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Maybe we get lucky enough to find a mentor that has an idea about the ditches and bumps, but that’s no guarantee. Navigating all this is part of the process and, frankly, I think it’s good for us. Maybe not <em>good</em>; maybe <strong>necessary</strong>.</p>
<p>Regardless, for now I think I’m most comfortable claiming that I’m on a constant path toward expertise. Maybe when I feel like I’ve finally claimed the prize I’ll let you know. Maybe, when I’m like Katie and have two-almost-three books under my belt, I’ll claim it. Until then, hi-ho, hi-ho.</p>
