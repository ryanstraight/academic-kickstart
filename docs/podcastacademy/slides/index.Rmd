## Brainstorm some topics!

# Pair, Share, Provide Feedback

## Pair up and share

## Provide feedback

???

We've already done the _thinking_ part, so now let's do the _pair/share_ part.

# **BREAKOUT**! Let's Outline a Script! - 15mins

.pull-left[

## You've got your pitch

## You've gotten some feedback

## Now let's outline this thing.

### Write a script if you like!

Ryan usually scripts his podcasts as they're more audio essays than anything else.

What if you want intervews/discussions/etc? Talking points! Bulleted is fine.

---

# Wares

## Let's talk hardware and software

???

Introduction to both. Ryan will take this.

---

# Hardware

## Microphones

## Headphones

## Recorders

## Oh, my!

???

Ryan: Let's look at some.

First, mics. Then headphones. Then recorders. Then peripherals.

---

# Software

## Lets of options!

???

Run through the software. Ryan uses Audition. Anyone use Audacity or others that can talk to those?

There are also others like Reaper, which is more for voiceover or audiobook recording, it seems, but is certainly a viable option if you already have it.

---

# **BREAKOUT**! Go record something - 45mins

.pull-left[

## Yup, you're actually going to record!

## Don't be afraid. This is just proof-of-concept

## Find a quiet spot, even your room

## Don't forget your clicker!

### Tips:

+ Stay more hydrated than you think you need to be.
+ Speak off-axis to mic.
+ Use a _ssh_ finger for plosives if you need to

]

???

Let folks go do their recording. Some down time, here. Call it a break, too.

# Pilot Postmortem

.pull-left[

## How'd it go?

## What worked?

## What didn't?

## Changes for next time?

# Metadata, naming, et cetera

## Figure this out early to save a lot of pain

+ Filenames: consistent, simple, at least 3 numerical digits! (_Example: Pod_001.mp3_)
+ Episode titles: Look at titles on iTunes, Stitcher, Etc. Pick what works for you.
+ Episode descriptions: Not too long but sufficiently explain your episode. Add guests here.
+ More...

???

This is all the finnicky stuff that you wish you'd known when you first started publishing.

# Publishing Your Podcast!

--

## Questions to ask yourself

--

### Do you have funding?

--

### How technical are you?

-- 

### Do you have help?

--

### Do you have to use your institution's ecosystem?
