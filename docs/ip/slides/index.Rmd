# Disrupting the IP mindset

.pull-left[
## 1. Acknowledge it.

You feel it. Others feel it. Be open and honest.

## 2. Focus on (and trust) your wins.

Big successes are made from many small ones.

## 3. Care a little less.

Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't go to for advice.

# Self-Assessments

## Values Assessment

>When you think of the times in your life where you have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind? When we focus on acting in concert with our values and judge ourselves on whether we acted in line with our values, it counters the negative messages we may get from the rest of the world or those around us.

# Self-Assessments

## Clance Scale

The Impostor Test was developed to help individuals determine whether or not they have IP characteristics and, if so, to what extent they are suffering. After taking the Impostor Test, add together the numbers of the responses to each statement. If the total score is 40 or less, the respondent has few Impostor characteristics; if the score is between 41 and 60, the respondent has moderate IP experiences; a score between 61 and 80 means the respondent frequently has Impostor feelings; and a score higher than 80 means the respondent often has intense IP experiences. The higher the score, the more frequently and seriously the Impostor Phenomenon interferes in a personâ€™s life.
