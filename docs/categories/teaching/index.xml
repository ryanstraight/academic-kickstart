&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#years-then-and-now-what-kinds-of-technology-were-you-using-25-years-ago-and-what-technology-do-you-engage-with-now&#34;&gt;25 years (then and now): What kinds of technology were you using 25 years ago and what technology do you engage with now?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-one-of-your-favorite-olc-experiences&#34;&gt;What is one of your favorite OLC experiences?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#who-composes-your-olc-community&#34;&gt;Who composes your OLC community?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to include something in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/weareolc-the-power-of-storytelling-at-accelerates-25th-anniversary/&#34;&gt;#WeAreOLC&lt;/a&gt; collection of narratives. Each of the posts in the series uses the same sort of framework: a few topics to get you started. So, without getting &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; wordy, here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-did-you-first-get-involved-with-the-olc&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did you first get involved with the OLC??&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first got involved because of the inimitable &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/angelagunder&#34;&gt;Angela Gunder&lt;/a&gt;, as is the case for so many, I’ve no doubt. I submitted an Innovation Studio talk/workshop/thing for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanstraight.com/2017/07/26/olc-innovate-2017/&#34;&gt;2017 OLC Innovate conference in New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. I got to talk about using Slack in online programs (something I’m still doing), which was a lot of fun. I also ended up working in the Lab, getting to wear the white lab coat and talk to folks about the cool stuff they were doing or wanting to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, it was in New Orleans, so. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;years-then-and-now-what-kinds-of-technology-were-you-using-25-years-ago-and-what-technology-do-you-engage-with-now&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;25 years (then and now): What kinds of technology were you using 25 years ago and what technology do you engage with now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was I doing 25 years ago in 1994? Well, I was in 7th grade. That’s actully pretty hard to believe. For me, I mean. You probably have no feelings on it one way or another. &lt;img src=&#34;cello.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;me playing cello circa 1994&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back then I had a Packard Bell computer. It had a 4x CD-rom drive and, if I recall correctly, 420M of harddrive space. I remember my friends being very impressed by this and claiming I’d “never fill that up!” (Spoiler: I did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played Doom and Descent and Hexen and Heretic and a MUD called “Apocalypse” (which, holy crap, &lt;a href=&#34;http://thewoodedglen.com/attn-apoc-mudders/&#34;&gt;is totally still around&lt;/a&gt;) and all was right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;apoc.png&#34; width=&#34;1164&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology I engage with now is… well, just browse this site. It’s everywhere. My field is &lt;strong&gt;human-computer interaction&lt;/strong&gt;, after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-one-of-your-favorite-olc-experiences&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is one of your favorite OLC experiences?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I can peg just one down, and that’s because of the next prompt: my favorite OLC experience has been the building of that community. Making the friends I’ve made. Sharing the times I’ve shared. Seeing everyone involved being better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;who-composes-your-olc-community&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who composes your OLC community?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve met people through OLC that I most likely never would have met otherwise and I am so grateful for it that it borders on weepy. The community has not just been a PLN but a group of friends that I always look forward to seeing whenever I get the chance. In fact, we all went in together on a more formalized (if informal… it’s unique) PLN called the &lt;strong&gt;SquadGoalsNetwork&lt;/strong&gt; and ended up winning an OLC Effective Practice Award for it. Not too shabby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to work with OLC a lot and it’s really opened me up to a huge collection of wonderful people and great opportunities. I look forward to continuing to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, me too, kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
