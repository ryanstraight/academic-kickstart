&lt;p&gt;I was invited to include something in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/weareolc-the-power-of-storytelling-at-accelerates-25th-anniversary/&#34;&gt;#WeAreOLC&lt;/a&gt; collection of narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did you first get involved with the OLC?
25 years (then and now): What kinds of technology were you using 25 years ago and what technology do you engage with now?
What is one of your favorite OLC experiences?
Who composes your OLC community (i.e. the people you have met along the way and always enjoy seeing)? Tell a story that shares about your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Me and OLC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first got involved because of the inimitable &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/angelagunder&#34;&gt;Angela Gunder&lt;/a&gt;, as is the case for so many, I’ve no doubt. I submitted an Innovation Studio talk/workshop/thing for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanstraight.com/2017/07/26/olc-innovate-2017/&#34;&gt;2017 OLC Innovate conference in New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. I got to talk about using Slack in online programs (something I’m still doing), which was a lot of fun. I also ended up working in the Lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;section&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1994&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was I doing 25 years ago in 1994? Well, I was in 7th grade. That’s actully pretty hard to believe. &lt;img src=&#34;cello.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;me playing cello circa 1994&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back then I had a Packard Bell computer. It had a 4x CD-rom drive and, if I recall correctly, 420M of harddrive space. I remember my friends being very impressed by this and claiming I’d “never fill that up!” (Spoiler: I did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played Doom and Descent and Hexen and Heretic and all was right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, me too, kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
