# Assignments

There are a number of assignments this week, as usual.

## Module 2 Activity

[This module's activity]({{< relref "activityB.markdown" >}}) covers descriptives and charts. 

## Quiz

Don't forget about your chapter quizzes! Find them in the Quizzes menu in D2L.

## Chapter 2 questions

1. Choose [a question from the end of chapter 2 in the section called "Exercises" to answer](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/graphing_distributions/ch2_exercises.html).  Post the question and your answer, and make sure to justify your response.

    For example, if you determine that a type of statistic is descriptive, provide your reasoning being specific about the problem presented and your answer.

1. Next, respond to another students' answers by asking a question for clarification, providing a personal experience, posting a thought-provoking question, taking a controversial, but professional stand, adding something new to the conversation, quoting another student's comment and add an additional idea based on this comment, etc.

    Your responses should be respectful and offered in a professional manner. You may wish to review the [behavior Course Policies](syllabus.html#threatening-behavior) to help frame your response. Remember, you will be responding about the specific idea, issue, or question.

*You may not answer a question that has been previously addressed.*
