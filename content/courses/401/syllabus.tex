\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\subsection{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course is a beginning level exploration of human-computer design,
interaction and interfaces. The students will be introduced to the
theory of human-computer interaction (HCI) as well as to the principles
of effective visual design using user experiences.

\hypertarget{course-overview}{%
\subsection{Course Overview}\label{course-overview}}

On completing this course, students will have participated in each step
of the interaction design process. They will be familiar with the
vocabulary, tools, and methodologies of an interaction designer and know
the role of each member of an interaction design team. Students will
understand how human-computer interaction fits in the larger topic of
interaction design.

This course utilizes a variety of educational activities to deliver and
assess understanding of the course content. Students will work in
collaborative groups to complete weekly questions from the reading
assignments, participate in activities during the weekly course
meetings, complete a series of five independent projects, and engage in
other activities as assigned.

We will cover many topics in this class, we will find ourselves in many
places and times, and we will be both historians and futurists. Any
study of the intersection of technology and education requires a foray
into myriad topics, including psychology, sociology, media studies,
gender studies, geo-politics, security, futurism and more. Be prepared
to become both consumers and creators. Bring your passion to this
collaborative experience and we will all benefit greatly.

This course has been updated for inclusion in the Cyber Security
program. With this inclusion, the notions of security/usability balance,
appropriate timing of security considerations, and the place of security
at various points in the design, development, and testing of user
interfaces is addressed. Through this, students will understand user
interface issues that will affect the implementation and perception of
security mechanisms and the behavioral impacts of various security
`policies.'

\hypertarget{weekly-assignments}{%
\subsection{Weekly Assignments}\label{weekly-assignments}}

Given the nature of this field, weekly participation in class-based
discussion is essential and required. Students will work collaboratively
weekly on a set of questions and prompts provided by the instructor.
Participation points double as attendance points. If you will miss the
class meeting you must \textbf{a}) notify your instructor 24 hours in
advance, \textbf{b}) watch the recorded class meeting, and \textbf{c})
take and submit your notes for that class meeting to the dropbox. (If it
wasn't made clear earlier, you benefit greatly from coming to class.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  160 points: 90 points spread out through 9 chapter response sets and
  10 points per week for 7 weeks of in-class participation (varies from
  attendance and other requirements)
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{annotated-bibliography}{%
\subsection{Annotated Bibliography}\label{annotated-bibliography}}

Students will produce an annotated bibliography with an introduction, a
conclusion, and in proper APA 6th edition style. See the LMS for many
resources on both writing an annotated bibliography and correctly using
6th edition APA. The topic of the bibliography is chosen by the student,
so long as it fits within the realm of HCI.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  25 points, evaluation and point distribution in assignment rubric.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{projects}{%
\subsection{Projects}\label{projects}}

Each module culminates in a project wherein students are provided with a
real-world problem to solve. Projects are individual in nature but may
require students to perform interview or testing simulations with third
parties outside the class. Each project has an associated (entirely
optional and bonus) User Experience Analysis that allows students to
apply what they've accomplished in the project to a more personal,
creative, familiar experience.

\textbf{Project 1: The Conceptual Model}

This project is intended to allow you to demonstrate your understanding
of the conceptual model, how it fits into the larger realm of
interaction design, and to flex your creative muscles. There is no
required format for how the material should be presented beyond using a
table where specified. Students will also reflect on the importance of
and need to include security considerations at the conceptual stage.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  30 points, evaluation and point distribution in assignment rubric.
\item
  \emph{5 bonus points for optional UXA}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Project 2: Personas}

This project aims at introducing students to the concept of personas and
their usefulness and place in the interaction design process. Personas
should be in narrative form and should include a photo, name, and
personal details that bring the persona to life. Each persona must
include likes, dislikes, and goals for visiting the site and be
referenced to the analytics data when possible. Students are also
introduced to Creative Commons and public domain materials.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  30 points, evaluation and point distribution in assignment rubric.
\item
  \emph{5 bonus points for optional UXA}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Project 3: Lo-Fi Prototypes}

Students are given a scenario in which they provide a low fidelity
prototype to a client for testing. Students will provide an appropriate
interface metaphor, interaction type, the paper prototype itself, a
step-by-step documentation of the interactions within the prototype (as
per the scenario), and a reflection of their process \emph{and} the
experience of having someone else `test' the prototype. Students'
artistic skills are not evaluated. Inclusion a of standards-based
authentication module is required.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  36 points, evaluation and point distribution in assignment rubric.
\item
  \emph{5 bonus points for optional UXA}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Project 4: The Heuristic Evaluation \& Security Audit}

Students will be introduced to methods for testing the usability of
websites and perform tests on real-world interfaces and best-practices
for site security as per OWASP. They will define different methods for
heuristically evaluating a website and choose the appropriate test given
example sites at different stages of development. Students will propose
methods for resolving issues given a site with a predefined set of
issues. Students will also provide a detailed evaluation and tear-down
of site security and provide industry-standard suggestions for
improvement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  30 points, evaluation and point distribution in assignment rubric.
\item
  \emph{5 bonus points for optional UXA}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Project 5: User \& Security Experience Testing}

Given a specific scenario, students will develop a usability testing
plan for a website that addresses a particular client request. Students'
testing plans will cover the scope, purpose, testing sessions,
participant descriptions, scenarios, quantitative and qualitative
metrics, the roles performed by those in the testing group, and an
analysis of user experience regarding current security measures in place
on that website. Tests performed by the student will ultimately comply
with standards presented by Usability.gov and in part the OWASP Testing
Guide.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  50 points, evaluation and point distribution in assignment rubric.
\item
  \emph{5 bonus points for optional UXA}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{reflections}{%
\subsection{Reflections}\label{reflections}}

\textbf{Connections: Single Point of Failure}

Students will reflect on the strength as well as the fragility of
large-scale systems based on human-computer interaction. Introduced to
the concept of the `single point of failure,' students will critically
examine HCI from both technical and societal standpoints, as well as
their own assumptions and preconceptions about that complex
intersection.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  15 points, evaluation and point distribution in assignment rubric.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Final Reflection}

Students will subjectively reflect on the class as a whole (both in
content and delivery), addressing their expectations of the experience,
what they perceived (specifically regarding the online environment), and
what and how students felt were their biggest accomplishments and
hurdles throughout the semester. This is not intended to be a
replacement for TCEs.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{5 bonus points}

\hypertarget{grading-methodology}{%
\subsection{Grading Methodology}\label{grading-methodology}}

I believe teaching a class should be like good jazz: there's a basic
structure with which you start but you shouldn't be afraid to try
variations on a theme. That is to say, the assignments' and projects'
dates, point values, or even whether they are required may change
throughout the term, as may the specifics of the topics we cover. Please
be aware that with the exception of \emph{extremely} extraneous
circumstances (death in the immediate family, hospitalization, etc.),
\textbf{I \emph{do not}}** give out Incomplete grades**. You should be
keeping an eye on your grade throughout the semester and, if you have
any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{example-score-breakdown}{%
\subsection{Example Score Breakdown}\label{example-score-breakdown}}

I use a simple point scale calculated to a percentage automatically by
our LMS. I \emph{do not} round, so an effort to attain all points
possible is highly encouraged. Below is an initial grading breakdown for
this class. \emph{Note: this may change as the semester moves along and
point values shift or assignments are added or removed}. Point values
labeled with \emph{italics} are bonus and are not calculated into the
final grade total.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}

B & 80\% & 300.8 & 338.3\tabularnewline
C & 70\% & 263.2 & 300.7\tabularnewline
D & 60\% & We need to talk. & Now.\tabularnewline

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{evaluation}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}}

You'll notice this course does something a bit different with project
grades: first, I expect everyone to aim for the highest level of
achievement in a rubric; second, it is \textbf{your} responsibility to
explain \textbf{how} you achieve that level of proficiency, not to
simply state that you did. As such, you need to include in each
submission a \textbf{Grading Declaration}. On the last page of every
assignment (even if there is a Works Cited page, it should go at the
very end), simply copy the different criteria (Task 1: Objects, Task 2:
Attributes, etc) and state clearly, concisely, and specifically
\textbf{how you addressed them in your project}. A couple examples from
Project 1 could be (you should have a line for \emph{each of the items
in the rubric}, not just what I have here):

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Task 2: Detail}: I created four conceptual model tables that are
complete and each addresses one the four required sub-systems listed in
the assignment document.

\textbf{Mechanics}: Both I and a classmate proofread my submission,
looking for grammatical and spelling errors. I also double-checked my
citations with the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) criteria for APA
formatting.
\end{quote}

Each project has a rubric like the one below included in the assignment.
\emph{Use it as your} \textbf{guide} \emph{to create your Declaration}.
See
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uu7PWCWwSLsR_3q23I7xstV_OUgMAkdvVRZJ4nw61HM/edit?usp=sharing}{this
Google document} as an example (requires UA login).

Please note: While the majority of projects use rubrics, there are a few
projects that you will receive points for simply by completing them. If
a project does not have a rubric, I will note that in the assessment
section of each project. \textbf{You should still include a Grading
Declaration that explains how you fulfilled the assignment
requirements.}

Rubrics vary in form so I have provided an example of the rubric from
the Conceptual Model project.

This rubric has ten main criteria (left-hand column) and is split into
two major sections. The first section, Mechanics and Timeliness, involve
the logistics of the assignment. The second, the Content, contains the
criteria for the actual tasks involved in the assignment.

There are three levels of performance for each criteria - Accomplishing,
Progressing, and Beginning. My rubrics all follow the same basic
structure even if the performance level labels vary.

Notice that the criteria \emph{Timeliness} has no entry for the
Progressing or Beginning levels as I expect the assignment to be
submitted on time.

\hypertarget{gateway-requirements}{%
\subsection{Gateway Requirements}\label{gateway-requirements}}

Also be aware that there are \textbf{gateway requirements} prior to
reaching the assessment rubric. For example, if a project requires you
to submit an 8-10 page paper and your submission is only 6 pages (ie,
does not meet the gateway requirements) \textbf{I will simply not grade
it}. These gateway requirements are made clear in each assignment
document.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{course-schedule}{%
\section{Course Schedule}\label{course-schedule}}

The general course schedule is maintained in detail in the LMS. Recorded
class sessions are also available there. Attending class sessions (or
watching the recorded session if you missed class) and submitting your
notes to the appropriate weekly dropbox is \textbf{absolutely necessary
and vital} to your success in this class.

For the purposes of this class, weeks begin on MONDAY and the short week
at the beginning of the short semester is not figured into the schedule.
Therefore, week 1 begins on January 14. (January 9-13 should be used to
begin Week 1 assignments.)

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{course-technology}{%
\section{Course Technology}\label{course-technology}}

This is a technology-driven course. As such, you are required to have
ready access to a relatively modern computer and an account that allows
you to install software on that computer. You should also \emph{be
excited} to try and use new technologies. We do a lot of that.

The course website can be found on D2L at
\url{https://d2l.arizona.edu/}. Log in with your NetID. Note that course
content lives primarily within D2L but usually as Google Documents that
require you to use your UA account to access. Keep this in mind if you
use multiple Gmail accounts.

We will have a full-class chatroom/discussion board/forum on
\href{https://uasouth.slack.com}{Slack}. You will be able to log into
Slack via your Google Apps for Education account (it will use WebAuth).
\textbf{Having the Slack application installed on your phone is
required} (if possible).

Updating your profiles in both D2L and Slack is \textbf{required}. We're
spending a lot of time together, so no excuse to just be a NetID the
entire time. Picture, likes and dislikes, job title, degree, home
campus, the works.

You may be asked to use software that requires more processing power
than your computer has. Contact the instructor if you feel this will
prevent you from participating.

You will need to use your Google Apps for Education account to access
much of the course. My suggestion is to create a new browser profile,
sign in using your Google account, and use \emph{only} that profile for
schoolwork. I will not grant access to personal accounts.

Class meetings are hosted on Zoom. \textbf{It is REQUIRED that you have
a microphone and headphones for the class meetings}. (A cheap set of
earbuds will work if your laptop has a mic and you will be from a
relatively quiet place.) \textbf{You \emph{will be expected} to use
them}. Should we have a class activity that requires a microphone and
you do not have one you \emph{will not} receive credit for that
assignment. Having working headphones and a microphone is \textbf{not
negotiable}. The link to our Zoom class meeting room is available in the
LMS.

You will need to install the latest edition of the
\href{https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/}{Chrome browser} for this
class. Tech support is vastly simpler if everyone uses the same browser.

Document submissions are required to be in PDF format unless otherwise
noted. Assignments should also be in APA 6th ed.~formatting, which is
easily achieved using
\href{http://uabookstore.arizona.edu/technology/campuslicensing/default.asp}{Microsoft
Word} (free for students) or Google Documents (free for all) and
following the APA template in the \href{supplemental.html}{supplemental}
list.

policies found in the University Catalog:
\url{http://catalog.arizona.edu/policies}

\hypertarget{the-gateway}{%
\subsection{THE GATEWAY}\label{the-gateway}}

In order to access the content of the course you must first pass THE
GATEWAY, a syllabus quiz of sorts. It can be found in the LMS. You
\textbf{must} get 100\% on this ``quiz.'' Not having done this 7 days
after the semester start date may result in you being administratively
dropped from this class. (It sounds scary; it's not.)

\hypertarget{the-7.5-week-semester}{%
\subsection{The 7.5 Week Semester}\label{the-7.5-week-semester}}

The material covered and assignments required in a shortened 7.5 week
semester are equal to those in a full 16 week semester with half the
time allotted. Time management and ``working ahead'' are practical
necessities in an accelerated semester. \textbf{Do not fall behind}. ``I
didn't have time'' is not an acceptable excuse for missing assignments
or readings.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{final-exam}{%
\subsection{Final Exam}\label{final-exam}}

This course has no final exam, instead having a final project due the
next-to-last day of the semester.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{use-of-student-work}{%
\subsection{Use of Student Work}\label{use-of-student-work}}

Assignments completed for this course may be used as examples of student
work in an instructor portfolio. Names and other identifying elements
will be removed before inclusion. Students who do not wish their work to
be used must inform the instructor in writing before the start of the
second week of classes.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{student-workload}{%
\subsection{Student Workload}\label{student-workload}}

According to UA policy, at least 15 contact hours of recitation,
lecture, discussion, seminar, or colloquium, as well as a minimum of 30
hours of student homework are required for each unit of student credit.
A contact hour is the equivalent of 50 minutes of class time or 60
minutes of independent-study work. For an online course this equates to
45 hours of work per credit; 135 hours total for the semester in a
3-credit class (9 hours per week). The hour requirements specified above
represent minimums for average students, and considerable deviation
(more or less) of these requirements may occur. \textbf{In shortened,
accelerated 7.5 week classes this workload is doubled}.
\textbf{\emph{You should expect to spend 18 hours per week on this
class. Budget your time wisely and always look ahead.}}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{academic-dishonesty}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty}\label{academic-dishonesty}}

Cheating and plagiarism are unethical. Students are expected to do their
own work. Plagiarism includes copying or cutting and pasting from online
sources, taking information from a book or article, copying someone
else's paper, or having someone else do your work for you. \textbf{It
also includes re-submitting work you've previously submitted for another
class, something called self-plagiarism!} Research sources must be
properly documented. Students found cheating or intentionally
plagiarizing will receive a zero for the assignment and may be dismissed
from the class with a failing grade, required to attend workshops, have
a permanent note included on his or her transcript, or any combination
thereof to the instructor's discretion.

I take this \textbf{very seriously} and, as professional academics in
this field, I expect you to, as well. \textbf{When in doubt, cite!} See
our program website for a primer on APA style, citation, and avoiding
plagiarism and cheating.

In a development course like this it is likely you will come across much
in the way of inspiration, be it in class or through your own research.
Keep a constant log of all assets you either use in your work (free
vectors or audio clips, for example) or note down what the inspiration
was for a particular development choice. Being \emph{inspired} by
something you love is perfectly fine; simply \emph{using} it is not.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{plagiarism-and-cheating}{%
\subsection{Plagiarism and Cheating}\label{plagiarism-and-cheating}}

Integrity and ethical behavior are expected of every student in all
academic work. This Academic Integrity principle stands for honesty in
all class work, and ethical conduct in all labs and clinical
assignments. This principle is furthered by the student Code of Conduct
and disciplinary procedures established by ABOR Policies 5-308 through
5-404, all provisions of which apply to all University of Arizona
students. This Code of Academic Integrity is intended to fulfill the
requirement imposed by ABOR Policy 5-403.A.4 and otherwise to supplement
the Student Code of Conduct as permitted by ABOR Policy 5-308.C.1.

\emph{As a blanket policy} I have automated plagiarism checking enabled
for all assignments in all my classes. This is not meant to suggest I
expect anyone to plagiarize but to demonstrate how seriously I take
this.

\hypertarget{threatening-behavior}{%
\subsection{Threatening Behavior}\label{threatening-behavior}}

The University seeks to promote a safe environment where students and
employees may participate in the educational process without
compromising their health, safety or welfare. The Arizona Board of
Regents' Student Code of Conduct, ABOR Policy 5-308, prohibits threats
of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to
one's self. Threatening behavior can harm and disrupt the University,
its community and its families.

There will always be times when electronic communication will be

\hypertarget{nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy}{%
\subsection{Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment
Policy}\label{nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy}}

The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment
free of discrimination. Our classroom is a place where everyone is
encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those
opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where
such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or
discrimination of others.

See:
\url{http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\subsection{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

You're an adult -- be responsible for your attendance. Any absences
\textbf{must} be addressed with the instructor prior to class except in
emergencies. Missed classes may require a make-up assignment submitted
for partial credit. There are also a number of things that you are
expected to complete within the first week of class (these are listed
clearly in the LMS). Failure to do these can result in being
administratively dropped from the class. Likewise, no/poor attendance
throughout the beginning of the class can result in being
administratively dropped from the class. \emph{Note: instructors are
\textbf{\emph{not}} obligated to administratively drop students for
failure to participate.} If a student is administratively dropped
between weeks five through eight a ``W'' will be administered if he/she
has maintained a passing grade (60\% or higher). An ``E'' will be
administered for anything lower unless extenuating circumstances dictate
otherwise as deemed appropriate by the instructor. See the class
attendance policy in the General Catalog:
\url{http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{paperassignment-submission}{%
\subsection{Paper/Assignment
Submission}\label{paperassignment-submission}}

All assignments, papers, projects should be submitted in the specified
method based on the \emph{system time} in the class website. Due to the
frantic nature of design and development projects, \textbf{no late work
will be accepted for partial points}. Keep in mind, however, that much
work is iterative and \textbf{you are still expected to complete it as
later assignments/work are predicated on earlier assignments/work}. Be
aware that instructors \textbf{are not obligated} to accept late work at
all. Students are responsible for ensuring proper delivery of their
assignments/papers/projects. If an agreement has been made with the
instructor to accept work after the due date or in a unique format it is
\textbf{the student's responsibility} to let the instructor know when
this is done. Submissions of this nature may not necessarily be graded
and returned along the same schedule as others. This policy may change
for individual assignments. \textbf{Do not wait until the last minute to
submit}. Your router going down or your computer's clock being different
from that of the LMS are \textbf{not} valid reasons for being late. It
is also highly suggested you keep your `working' folder in Google Drive
or some other cloud-copy backup location like Box.net. Your University
of Arizona Google Apps for Education account comes with free, unlimited
storage. Use it.

\emph{All written assignments submitted should be properly formatted and
stylized. I \textbf{\emph{require}} that the American Psychological
Association, 6\textbf{th} ed, revised manual be followed. Period.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{grading-turn-around-time}{%
\subsection{Grading Turn-Around Time}\label{grading-turn-around-time}}

Please note that I generally do not begin to grade an assignment until
on or after the due date since it is my preference to grade all
students' submissions at one time, as well as return grades and feedback
simultaneously. I will do my best to provide grades and useful feedback
expediently.

However, some submissions require me to spend a significant time working
through the materials. This may cause me to be delayed in grading that
project. Additionally, if I am traveling I may be delayed in grading
your submission. If this happens I will let everyone know.

NOTE: You are expected to retain an electronic copy of all work
submitted. If transmission of the work fails, you are expected to
``resend'' the document or message (in the case of online discussions).
This is entirely your responsibility.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\subsection{Communication}\label{communication}}

I am nearly always available through electronic means. My policy is that
I will respond \emph{usually} immediately, \emph{mostly} within 24
hours, and \emph{at the latest} to questions within 48 hours (or by
Monday morning if sent during the weekend, during which I do not work).
If I do not respond in this windows do not hesitate to bug me. All
questions that are class-related and not personal in nature should be
posted in Slack to the class channel so everyone can benefit from the
response (or chime in). Personal issues may be sent via direct message
(DM). \textbf{All} emails sent to me should have subjects beginning with
\textbf{INFV 401} or \textbf{ETCV 401}. All emails I send (that are not
automatically created by the LMS) will have the same. This makes finding
things considerably easier. Still, I reiterate: Slack is the better way
to contact me.

Also note that I do not respond to communications about making up missed
work or improving grades during the end of the semester. It is your
responsibility to keep an eye on your grade throughout the semester and
contact me with your concerns before the course is nearly ended. If you
missed some points in week 2 you should not be petitioning me in week 7
to make them up.

tl;dr: in this order, use Slack, email, text, phone call

\subsection{Social Media Policy}\label{social-media-policy}}

Should this course require participation in social media you have the
option of using ``burner'' accounts should you feel uncomfortable with
using a personal account for academic work. You may even choose to use a
unique, unrelated email account to sign up for various platforms. You
are in no way required to follow, friend, etc., your instructor, only to
provide information about the account you decided to use.

The reason for this policy is as follows: if you are active on social
media already and want to combine your personal and
professional/academic activities, you may; if you are active on social
media and \emph{do not} want to mingle your personal and
professional/academic activities, you have that option (this method is
preferred for students); if you are \emph{not} active on social media
and have no intention of maintaining a presence after this course,
simply abandon or delete your burner account. It is your instructor's
wish to reap the benefits of developing personal learning networks and
getting global perspectives while maintaining a safe, secure environment
for you.

\subsection{Office Hours and Scheduling
Meetings}\label{office-hours-and-scheduling-meetings}}

I have a \emph{virtual} open-door policy. That is to say, feel free to
send me a DM and see if I'm available to chat any time. I like to think
of it as dropping by the department's building and peeking your head in
my door. Just as it is in person, I'm not always available right that
second, so you're welcome to `wait in the hall' (until I've finished
doing whatever I was doing) or schedule an appointment with me. I'm
happy to do a video conference via Slack (preferably), Zoom meet in
person on Main Campus or in my office on the Pima East campus, as I live
in Tucson.

\section{Accessibility and
Accommodations}\label{accessibility-and-accommodations}}

At the University of Arizona we strive to make learning experiences as
accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience physical or
academic barriers based on disability or pregnancy, you are welcome to
let me know so that we can discuss options. You are also encouraged to
contact Disability Resources (520) 621-3268 to explore reasonable
accommodation.

If our class meets at a campus location: Please be aware that the
accessible table and chairs in this room should remain available for
students who find that standard classroom seating is not usable.

If you have special needs as addressed by the Americans with
Disabilities Act and need course materials in alternative formats or
need any special accommodations, please notify your course instructor(s)
and contact the Disability Resource Center immediately at 520-621-3268
or get information from DRC web site: \url{http://drc.arizona.edu}.

\hypertarget{basic-securities}{%
\subsection{Basic Securities}\label{basic-securities}}

Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing
sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place
to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course,
is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore,
please notify the professor if you are comfortable in doing so. This
will enable them to provide any resources that they may possess.

\hypertarget{what-to-expect}{%
\section{What to Expect}\label{what-to-expect}}

Given the nature of our field, it is entirely possible that materials
considered adult, controversial, or objectionable in nature will crop up
from time to time. We will be spending the majority of our time on the
Internet and we should not only understand but respect the fact that it
is a free and open place. As responsible adults, I encourage and expect
everyone to be safe, smart, and secure when engaged online. Should you
have any questions or concerns about content, please email me to discuss
an alternative assignment.

\hypertarget{non-endorsement-policy}{%
\subsection{Non-Endorsement Policy}\label{non-endorsement-policy}}

In the course of accessing the online resources available in this course
you will encounter a number of advertisements. We can not remove them
from the material so it is your choice if you explore any of the
advertising you encounter. However, the University does not endorse any
of these advertisements.

\section{A Personal Note}\label{a-personal-note}}

We live in a digital age. We communicate through digital means. While I
fully expect your submitted assignments to employ proper spelling,
grammar, construction, and styling, I not only allow but expect and
encourage you to express yourself using whatever communicative means you
like. I will use emoticons; I will type in the text chat without using
proper capitalization and punctuation; I will use `reaction gifs' and
make references to memes in casual situations; I will share entertaining
but relevant media. If I can do it, so can you. Just remember: a place
and time for everything, just as the way you speak with friends on a
Friday night out is not the same as when you're giving a conference
presentation. Context is everything.
