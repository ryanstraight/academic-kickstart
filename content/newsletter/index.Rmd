Every other week I put out the [The New Professor](https://thenewprofessor.com) podcast. On every *other* other week, I send out a newsletter! Well, something adjacent to a newsletter, anyway.^[You'll get *at most* one every other week and you'll *never* get spammed. Doesn't that sound nice? And honestly, you're lucky if you get one a month. I'm really bad at keeping this up.]

Each email consists of:  
1) a little bit of writing by me, whether that's something about the news or some personal updates or whatever is on my mind that doesn't constitute a full publication (that's the **read** part),  
2) a video that I think is worth checking out, sometimes music videos and sometimes just weird stuff (that's the **watch**), and  
3) a picture of one of our dogs (that's, if you can believe it, the **woof**).

Why a picture of the dogs? I mean, [have you *seen* our dogs](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHIHad6WoAAz7GY.jpg)?
