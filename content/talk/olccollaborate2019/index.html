location: "University of Hawai'i Maui College, Maui, Hawai'i"
summary: Games, engagement, and representation.
abstract: "How are indigenous and multicultural identities represented in video games? How can games be used to engage underrepresented groups and support deep learning in higher education? In this talk, Dr. Straight explores phenomena like gamification, game-based learning, and best practices for including these incredibly powerful but often mis- or under-utilized instructional strategies in supporting multicultural perspectives in education. He suggests ways in which, through these lenses, video games can create better understanding, engage underrepresented groups, and support more authentic learning experiences."
