<p>It’s been a long time since I was on the <em>Dean’s List</em> but it happened again last month (just not the way you probably think).</p>
<p>Turns out I was included in a list of “Influencers.” Pretty good company, too, if you take a look at the list. What’s interesting about this is not so much that I’m an “influencer,” (although, pretty cool, I know), it’s the cascading coverage that’s stemmed from it. For example, a number of UA-published pieces and no shortage of tweets. But this got me to thinking about more than just publicity; it got me thinking about <strong>public</strong>ity.</p>
<p>Now, given the title of this post, I want to make it clear that I’m not suggesting being added to a list of “Influencers” makes me a scholar. That comes from years of work. And here’s my point about the <strong>public</strong>ity: I really like the notion of <em>public scholars</em>[], mostly because so much of what we as academics do is never seen by the world. Heck, a good chunk of it doesn’t even come out on our annual reviews. Think about all those times you’ve spent 3 hours researching so you could write one sentence. That sunken time, that invisible cost, is valuable.</p>
<p>This is most often now, I think, exemplified by the <em>science communicator</em>. While it makes sense to have an intermediary when highly technical but publicly-valauble knowledge needs dessiminating, it’s not just the hard sciences that should benefit from this sort of translation to the easily digestable. Why not <em>education communicators</em>? Or <em>history communicators</em>? Or <em><strong>math</strong> communicators</em>?</p>
<p>Of course, we do have people like this but there still seems to be a particular and peculiar divide between <em>science communicators</em> and others in various fields simply <em>writing popular (insert topic here)</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just me. I dunno.</p>
