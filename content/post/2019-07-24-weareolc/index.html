<p>I was invited to include something in the <a href="https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/weareolc-the-power-of-storytelling-at-accelerates-25th-anniversary/">#WeAreOLC</a> collection of narratives. Each of the posts in the series uses the same sort of framework: a few topics to get you started. So, without getting <em>too</em> wordy, here they are:</p>
<div id="how-did-you-first-get-involved-with-the-olc" class="section level2">
<h2>How did you first get involved with the OLC??</h2>
<p>I first got involved because of the inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/angelagunder">Angela Gunder</a>, as is the case for so many, I’ve no doubt. I submitted an Innovation Studio talk/workshop/thing for the <a href="https://ryanstraight.com/2017/07/26/olc-innovate-2017/">2017 OLC Innovate conference in New Orleans</a>. I got to talk about using Slack in online programs (something I’m still doing), which was a lot of fun. I also ended up working in the Lab, getting to wear the white lab coat and talk to folks about the cool stuff they were doing or wanting to do.</p>
<p>Plus, it was in New Orleans, so. Yeah.</p>

<div id="years-then-and-now-what-kinds-of-technology-were-you-using-25-years-ago-and-what-technology-do-you-engage-with-now" class="section level2">
<h2>25 years (then and now): What kinds of technology were you using 25 years ago and what technology do you engage with now?</h2>
<p>So what was I doing 25 years ago in 1994? Well, I was in 7th grade. That’s actully pretty hard to believe. For me, I mean. You probably have no feelings on it one way or another. <img src="cello.jpg" alt="me playing cello circa 1994" /></p>
<p>Anyway, back then I had a Packard Bell computer. It had a 4x CD-rom drive and, if I recall correctly, 420M of harddrive space. I remember my friends being very impressed by this and claiming I’d “never fill that up!” (Spoiler: I did.)</p>
<p>I played Doom and Descent and Hexen and Heretic and a MUD called “Apocalypse” (which, holy crap, <a href="http://thewoodedglen.com/attn-apoc-mudders/">is totally still around</a>) and all was right with the world.</p>
<p><img src="apoc.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The technology I engage with now is… well, just browse this site. It’s everywhere. My field is <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>, after all!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-one-of-your-favorite-olc-experiences" class="section level2">
<h2>What is one of your favorite OLC experiences?</h2>
<p>I don’t think I can peg just one down, and that’s because of the next prompt: my favorite OLC experience has been the building of that community. Making the friends I’ve made. Sharing the times I’ve shared. Seeing everyone involved being better for it.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-composes-your-olc-community" class="section level2">
<h2>Who composes your OLC community?</h2>
<p>I’ve met people through OLC that I most likely never would have met otherwise and I am so grateful for it that it borders on weepy. The community has not just been a PLN but a group of friends that I always look forward to seeing whenever I get the chance. In fact, we all went in together on a more formalized (if informal… it’s unique) PLN called the <strong>SquadGoalsNetwork</strong> and ended up winning an OLC Effective Practice Award for it. Not too shabby!</p>
<p>I get to work with OLC a lot and it’s really opened me up to a huge collection of wonderful people and great opportunities. I look forward to continuing to do so in the future.</p>
