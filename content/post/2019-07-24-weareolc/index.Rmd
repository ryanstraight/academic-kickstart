OLC has been around for 25 years. Here's what I was doing back then.
<!--more-->

I was invited to include something in the [#WeAreOLC](https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/weareolc-the-power-of-storytelling-at-accelerates-25th-anniversary/) collection of narratives. 

How did you first get involved with the OLC?
25 years (then and now): What kinds of technology were you using 25 years ago and what technology do you engage with now?
What is one of your favorite OLC experiences?
Who composes your OLC community (i.e. the people you have met along the way and always enjoy seeing)? Tell a story that shares about your relationship.

## Me and OLC



## 1994

<img style="float: right;" src="cello.jpg" alt="me playing cello circa 1994" />So what was I doing 25 years ago in 1994? Well, I was in 7th grade. That's actully pretty hard to believe. 




And yeah, me too, kid.
