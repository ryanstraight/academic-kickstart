summary: 'OLC Innovate! First time. ~~Probably~~ (2018 update: **definitely**) not last. I had a great time that was compounded by being able to bring Adri long with me (not to the conference itself but she hadd never been to New Orleans before and, boy, did she enjoy it).'

<p>OLC Innovate! First time. <del>Probably</del> (2018 update: <strong>definitely</strong>) not last. I had a great time that was compounded by being able to bring Adri long with me (not to the conference itself but she’d never been to New Orleans before and, boy, did she enjoy it).</p>
<p>The trip started out kinda strange, though… the plane’s lights were entirely <em>blue</em>. Not just blue-ish but <strong>blue</strong>. Felt like a scene from <em>In the Mouth of Madness</em>.</p>
<!-- ![I think the person that designed the lighting in this model must've been a fan of In the Mouth of Madness.](olc-innovate-2017/2017-07-26-08-07-29-IMG_20170404_202153.jpg) -->

<p>The <a href="https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/attend-2018/innovate">OLC Innovate</a> conference (happening in Nashville, TN next April) seeks to “conduct a series of engaging hands-on workshops aimed at fostering organic interactions and collaborative cross-disciplinary problem solving.”</p>
<p>I spent my time in the <a href="https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/innovate/program/innovation-lab/">Innovation Lab</a>, a “dedicated space at the conference for you to explore the pervasive challenges we face in the classroom and to craft innovative approaches for better reaching our unique populations of learners.” Had a great time with the other lab techs–folks like <a href="http://daveg.msu.domains/about/">Dave</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/drsrcrawford">Steven</a> and <a href="http://keeganslw.com/">Keegan</a> and <a href="http://www.johnastewart.org/">John</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bscragg">Ben</a> and <a href="http://annmusgrove.com/">Ann</a> and <a href="http://www.phylisebanner.com/">Phylise</a>–and am looking forward to working with them again in the future.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pictures from the conference.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s more to New Orleans than just being a great conference town. If you want to see a <em>lot</em> of photos, they’re over here…</p>
