New Orleans is one of my favorite cities to visit. The food, the sights, the art. Here are a bunch of photos we took!

## Photos

We took a trip to Lafeyette Cemetery! Well, one of them. And the Voodoo Museum. Enjoy! (Click on a photo to lightbox.)

```{r cemetery, echo=FALSE}

Oh, and if you're wandering through the French Quarter, make sure to stop into Galatoires and ask for the Sazerac with a history lesson and the "special pour."
