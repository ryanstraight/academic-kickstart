<p>And I mean some <em>serious</em> basics. Having narrative included with the examples really helps me learn so Iâ€™ll present some of that here. Iâ€™ll add a list of various learning materials at the very end. The content here is a mish-mash of pretty much all of them.</p>
<div id="absolute-basics" class="section level2">
<h2>Absolute basics</h2>
<div id="math" class="section level3">
<h3>Math</h3>
<p>Python can be used as a calculator. For example:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>2 + 4</code></pre>
<p>will display <code>6</code>. As you would imagine. Some other examples:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>4 / 2 # will display 2
4 * 3 # will display 12
5 ** 2 # is how Python addresses exponents, so this will display 25</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately, when youâ€™ve got a long number in your code that you need to keep readable, you can insert underscores and Python will ignore them. So instead of <code>8675309</code> you can write <code>867_5309</code> and Python will understand them both the same way. I prefer to keep my scripts and code as human-readable as possible. This is one way of doing that.</p>
</div>
<div id="print" class="section level3">
<h3>Print</h3>
<p>The classic:</p>
<p><code>print("Hello, world!")</code></p>
<p>This simply prints the text in the quotation marks. Simple as that. But more on this in a bit.</p>
</div>
<div id="variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Variables</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>var = 10 # While you can use = in R to set this, you can&#39;t use &lt;- in Python
print(var) # This prints the content of the variable that we created (var).</code></pre>
<p>So if you run the code, as below, youâ€™ll see it displays the value of the variable <code>var</code>, which is 10.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>var = 10
print(var)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 10</code></pre>
<p>Iâ€™m coming from R, so I tend to use that as a reference point. Youâ€™ll see that a lot. ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>Before we get into lists, you can create arrays of assignments like so:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>a, b, c = 1, 2, 3</code></pre>
<p>Which assigns the variables and values <code>a = 1</code>, <code>b = 2</code>, and <code>c = 3</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="lists" class="section level3">
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>The first thing to remember about Pythons and lists (or counting, in general) is that it starts with <strong>0</strong>. So if you create a list like this of a generic collection of everyday carry items:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>edc = [&#39;notebook&#39;, &#39;sunglasses&#39;, &#39;wallet&#39;, &#39;keys&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>then, if you want to reference <code>book</code> in that list, it is actually position <strong>0</strong>. So,</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(edc[1])</code></pre>
<p>will return <code>sunglasses</code>, not <code>notebook</code>. Likewise, if you use <code>[-1]</code> as the index number, it will <em>always</em> give you the very last item in the list. In this case, <code>keys</code>.</p>
</div>
