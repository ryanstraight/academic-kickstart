As I have gotten such an education from her site and her Twitter feed, I was inspired to use a variation on [Alison Presmanes Hill's license](https://alison.rbind.io/license/):

>The content on the site is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

<i class="fab fa-creative-commons-by fa-2x"></i>
<i class="fab fa-creative-commons-nc fa-2x"></i>
<i class="fab fa-creative-commons-sa fa-2x"></i></center>

Essentially, this means:

## You are free to:

**Share**: copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format

**Adapt**: remix, transform, and build upon the material

## Under the following terms:

**Attribution**: You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

**NonCommercial**: You may not use the material for commercial purposes.^[As far as I'm concerned, if you use anything to help you with your "work," that's great. Just don't take and sell, basically.]

**ShareAlike**: If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original
